        <p>India will usher in a new era as it paces towards the 100th year of Independence and will be known for its “many achievements and many accomplishments” as one of the leading nations across the world, National Security Advisor Ajit Doval said on Friday.</p>

        <p>"It will be a different India at that time. India is on the march and you will see that you will be leading these police forces at a time when it will bring India which has got a new place in the international arena," Doval told young Indian Police Service (IPS) officers in Hyderabad.</p>

            The quintessence of democracy does not lie in the ballot box but it lies in the laws which are made by the people who are elected by or are elected through those ballot boxes, Doval said.
            
            “You are the ones who are the enforcers of those laws. Laws are not as good as they are made. Laws are as good as they are executed and implemented and service the people are going to get out of them,” he said.
            
            “The implementation of those laws are important. No nation can be built where rule of law has failed. People cannot feel safe and secure where law enforcers are weak, corrupt, partisan," he maintained.</p>
            <p>"…Not only the policing<a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news"> hindustan times</a> about which you have been trained very well. But it will extend. You will be responsible for the border management of this country. Fifteen-thousand km of the border, most of it has got these peculiar problems of its own," he added.

                "There is a border in Pakistan with China or Myanmar or Bangladesh. We have got different types of security-related issues which are manned by the police and the central police organisations which are manning these borders," Doval said.
